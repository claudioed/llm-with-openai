      "## Different Ways to Deploy a React JS Application to AWS\n",
      "\n",
      "Deploying a React JS application to AWS can be achieved through various methods. Here are three common ways to do so, along with their pros and cons:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Amazon S3 and CloudFront\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Pros:**\n",
      "  - **Simple to set up:** Deploying a static site to S3 is straightforward, and integrating CloudFront can easily enable CDN capabilities.\n",
      "  - **Cost-effective:** S3 and CloudFront are pay-as-you-go services, making them affordable for small-scale applications.\n",
      "  - **Scalable:** Automatically scales to accommodate traffic spikes without any manual intervention.\n",
      "  - **Global distribution:** CloudFront ensures your application is served quickly to users around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Cons:**\n",
      "  - **Static only:** Best suited for static sites. Dynamic content or server-side rendering requires additional configurations or services.\n",
      "  - **Limited server-side control:** Custom server configurations or backend integrations need alternative approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. AWS Elastic Beanstalk\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Pros:**\n",
      "  - **Easy to use:** Elastic Beanstalk simplifies the deployment process by handling the provisioning and management of the underlying infrastructure.\n",
      "  - **Supports multiple environments:** Easily manage different environments (development, staging, production) within the same application.\n",
      "  - **Auto-scaling:** Automatically scales your application up or down based on demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Cons:**\n",
      "  - **Cost:** While it provides a lot of conveniences, it can be more expensive than managing your own EC2 instances, especially at scale.\n",
      "  - **Less control:** Offers less control over the AWS resources compared to manually managing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. AWS Amplify\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Pros:**\n",
      "  - **Fully managed:** AWS Amplify provides a fully managed service, including CI/CD pipelines, for deploying web applications.\n",
      "  - **Feature-rich:** Comes with built-in features for authentication, data storage, backend APIs, and more.\n",
      "  - **Easy to start:** Simplifies the setup process, especially for developers unfamiliar with AWS.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Cons:**\n",
      "  - **Cost:** Can become expensive as usage grows, especially with additional features enabled.\n",
      "  - **Learning curve:** Requires understanding of the Amplify framework and its conventions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggested Deployment Strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the requirements:\n",
      "- Small team of 3 developers\n",
      "- Faster deployment using AWS CloudFormation\n",
      "- Lower cost\n",
      "- Up to 1000 users, with around 100 concurrent users\n",
      "\n",
      "**Amazon S3 and CloudFront** would be the best way to deploy the React JS application. This approach is cost-effective, supports fast deployments, and can easily handle the expected user load. Using AWS CloudFormation, you can automate the deployment process, making it easier for a small team to manage. Additionally, the scalability of S3 and CloudFront ensures that the application can handle traffic spikes without any manual intervention.\n",
