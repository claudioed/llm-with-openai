Here is a list of potential microservices along with a description of each one:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Transaction Monitoring Service**\n",
      "   - Description: This service continuously monitors transactions in real-time to identify any unusual patterns or behaviors that could indicate fraudulent activity. It uses behavior analysis to compare current transactions against historical data and detect anomalies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Risk Scoring Service**\n",
      "   - Description: This service assigns a risk score to each transaction based on various factors such as transaction amount, frequency, user history, and more. The risk score determines the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Machine Learning Model Service**\n",
      "   - Description: This service manages the lifecycle of machine learning models that are used to predict and identify fraudulent transactions. It includes model training, evaluation, deployment, and updating.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Rules Engine Service**\n",
      "   - Description: This service applies a set of predefined rules to transactions to identify potential fraud. These rules can be static or dynamic and may include criteria like geographic location, payment method, or velocity checks.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Alerts and Notifications Service**\n",
      "   - Description: This service generates and sends alerts to the appropriate personnel or systems when a suspicious transaction is detected. It ensures that potential fraud is reviewed and acted upon promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Case Management Service**\n",
      "   - Description: Once a suspicious transaction is identified, this service manages the investigation process. It tracks the status of the case, assigns it to investigators, and stores all relevant information until the case is resolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **User Behavior Profiling Service**\n",
      "   - Description: This service creates and maintains profiles of user behavior to support the detection of anomalies. It collects data on how users typically interact with the system and uses this information to spot deviations.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Data Enrichment Service**\n",
      "   - Description: This service enriches transaction data with additional context that can be used to assess risk. It might integrate with external databases or services to pull in information such as device fingerprinting, IP analysis, or customer reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Compliance Reporting Service**\n",
      "   - Description: This service ensures that all fraud detection and prevention activities are in compliance with relevant regulations and standards. It generates reports for internal use and regulatory submissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Feedback Loop Service**\n",
      "    - Description: This service collects feedback from the fraud investigation outcomes to improve the accuracy of the fraud detection models and rules. It uses this feedback to refine risk scoring and machine learning algorithms.\n",

      "This diagram uses the Entity Relationship syntax supported by mermaid to illustrate the relationships between the entities and value objects. Here's a brief explanation of the diagram:\n",
      "\n",
      "- A `CASE` has a one-to-many relationship with `CASE_NOTE` and `DOCUMENT`, meaning a case can have multiple notes and documents.\n",
      "- An `INVESTIGATOR` has a one-to-many relationship with `CASE`, indicating that an investigator can work on multiple cases.\n",
      "- `CASE_STATUS` is a value object and is represented without relationships as it is typically immutable and does not have a direct relationship with `CASE` in this context. However, the `Status` attribute in `CASE` would be of type `CASE_STATUS`.\n",
      "- Primary keys (PK) are denoted for each entity and value object to indicate unique identifiers.\n",
      "- Foreign keys (FK) are used to show references to other entities.\n",
