# LLM Tools for Architects

Welcome to the LLM Tools for Architects GitHub repository! This project is dedicated to helping architects make informed daily decisions regarding technology stacks, domain-driven design, and more, leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## About

In the fast-paced world of software architecture, making the right choices in technology stacks and design principles is crucial for project success. This repository offers a collection of tools and utilities powered by LLMs to assist architects in navigating these decisions. From generating technology stack comparisons to providing insights into domain-driven design, our tools are here to support you in creating robust and scalable architectures.

## Features

- **Tech Stack Advisor**: Offers recommendations and comparisons between different technology stacks based on project requirements and current industry trends.
- **Domain-Driven Design Helper**: Generates domain models and design patterns tailored to your specific project needs, promoting a clean and maintainable codebase.
- **Architecture Pattern Generator**: Provides insights and templates for various architectural patterns, helping you choose the most suitable pattern for your project.
- **Code Examples and Snippets**: Access a wide range of code examples and snippets for common architectural scenarios, directly applicable to your projects.
